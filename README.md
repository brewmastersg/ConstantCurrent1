# ConstantCurrent1

My telepresense robot for Contextual Electronics - Roll With It (RWI) project requires a constant current sink to test the battery.

My batter system is quite a bit bigger than Chris's so I've got a LOT more power. I'm using a 12V (nominal, 14V more like on a full charge), 10AHr battery and I don't want testing to take all day. So I've targeted a 5 amp sink. 

5A at 14V is... 70 watts...

That's why I've pentupled my FETs and power resistors. Heatsinks everywhere!
